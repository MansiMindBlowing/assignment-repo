http request response lifcycle


The HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) request-response cycle is the communication process between a client (like a browser) and a server (like your Node.js app).

It works like this:

Client sends an HTTP request

Server receives and processes the request

Server sends back an HTTP response

Client receives and renders (or uses) the response
